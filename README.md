# Speech-to-Text-model
simple speech to text model
this code uses google recognizer for speech recognition
remember preferrably give the input in wave audio form
to use your microphone of device for input , use pyaudio module
pyaudio module has "some wheel creation error" on colab and kaggle mainly in Windows os , use better use on linux/macos
any improvement to code are higly appreciated
